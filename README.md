Hover over game to view instructions here: 

WASD to move the purple snake. IJKL to move the red snake. Press "N" to reset the game. 
Click the board before playing to control the snakes. The goal of the game is to be the first one to get your snake 21 units long. 
If the head of the snakes collide, both snakes will be reduced to three units and randomly placed on the board. Colliding with yourself will reset the snake. 
The leading snake (green) will not be able to warp walls and will reset on contact. Updates for this game will be released or posed so be sure to check for newer versions of this game to come. 
I appreciate your support by playing my game and/or editing my code. 
(CHALLENGE) control both snakes simultaneously if playing alone. P.S.... Try holding "R"
