# Snake-vs-Snake
This is my spin-off of the game "Snake". I have made it into a 2-player HTML game in which you have to battle to get your snake to 21 units long to make the other snake disappear. Also, when the snakes are equal in length, the snakes will be their original color and both snakes can warp walls. When the snakes are unequal in length, the longest snake will no longer be able to warp on walls and turn green. The collision with self is working fair but the collision of the two snakes has issues I have yet to figure out. This is like a beta version of it because I have yet to really figure out what to actually do with it. The link to my website I have for it is here: https://sites.google.com/view/doosons-games/home
